# Deployment Guide for InfinityFree Hosting

## Understanding the Issue

You're experiencing a MIME type validation error when uploading CSS files to InfinityFree:
```
The upload failed: File content validation failed: detected MIME type 'text/plain' does not match expected types for '.css' extension. Expected: text/css
```

This is a server-side validation issue where InfinityFree is checking the content of your files and determining that they don't match the expected MIME types.

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Use FTP Instead of Web File Manager

The most reliable solution is to use an FTP client like FileZilla:

1. Download and install FileZilla Client from https://filezilla-project.org/
2. Get your FTP credentials from InfinityFree:
   - Host/Server: Find this in your InfinityFree control panel
   - Username: Your InfinityFree username
   - Password: Your FTP password
   - Port: Usually 21
3. Connect to your InfinityFree account using FileZilla
4. Upload the contents of your `dist` folder to the `htdocs` or `public_html` directory

### Solution 2: Try Different Upload Methods in InfinityFree

1. Look for alternative file upload options in your InfinityFree control panel
2. Some hosting providers have multiple file managers or upload methods
3. Try using the "Remote FTP" or similar option if available

### Solution 3: Upload Files Individually

Instead of uploading the entire assets folder:
1. Upload the index.html file first
2. Then upload just the JavaScript file (index-*.js)
3. Finally, try uploading the CSS file (style-*.css)

### Solution 4: Contact InfinityFree Support

Since this appears to be a server-side configuration issue:
1. Contact InfinityFree support through their website
2. Explain that you're getting MIME type validation errors when uploading CSS files
3. Ask them if there's a specific way to upload files or if they can adjust their validation settings

## Cloudflare Pages Deployment (Recommended)

Cloudflare Pages is a modern hosting platform that's perfect for static sites like this one. It offers:

- Free hosting with automatic SSL
- Global CDN for fast loading
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Custom domain support

### Deployment Steps:

1. Go to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and sign in or create an account
2. Connect your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab)
3. Select your repository
4. Configure the build settings:
   - Framework preset: None (or Vite if available)
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `dist`
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Your site will be deployed to a `*.pages.dev` subdomain

### Configuration Files:

We've included configuration files for Cloudflare deployment:
- `wrangler.toml` - Configuration for Cloudflare Workers
- `_routes.json` - Routing configuration for Cloudflare Pages
- `static.json` - Static site configuration

## Alternative Hosting Options

If you continue to have issues with InfinityFree, consider these free hosting alternatives:
- Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/)
- Vercel (https://vercel.com/)
- Cloudflare Pages (https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/)

These platforms are designed specifically for modern web applications and have better support for static sites generated by tools like Vite.

## Files to Upload

When you're ready to upload, make sure to upload all files from the `dist` folder:
- index.html (main HTML file)
- assets/index-99221010.js (JavaScript bundle)
- assets/style.9b8951e2.css (CSS styles)
- .htaccess (configuration file for proper MIME types)

The .htaccess file we created should help with MIME type handling on the server side.
